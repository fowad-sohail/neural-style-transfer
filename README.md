# Neural Style Transfer
An implementation of Neural Style Transfer in a Jupyter Notebook

## Motivation
This was completed as a part of Coursera's [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) completed in the Fall of 2019. This notebook was inspiration for a recent project StyleShift - a web application that allows users to feed their own images into a model trained for Neural Style Transfer. You can find the StyleShift website [here](http://styleshift.vercel.app) and the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/fowad-sohail/styleshift).
